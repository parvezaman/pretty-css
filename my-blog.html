Watching movies and television programmes in the English language is also a great and fun way to learn it! At ELC we encourage students to participate in the social programme to practice English outside a class environment. Activities include watching popular English films, sports, art galleries, museums, trips and excursions to local and historical areas. The programme is designed to encourage students to use and learn English in British culture.</p>
